# Introduction

## Getting started

There are two different frameworks you can use for creating visualizations and dashboards. The classic Splunk dashboards and visualizations framework uses Simple XML as the source code and has a limited user interface. The splunk Dashboard Studio framework uses JSON-formatted stanzas as the source code for the objects in a dashboard, and for the entire dashboard. The user interface, or visual editor, has many formatting options.
### The visualization and dashboard workflow

You might need to generate a new visualization or edit an existing dashboard. Working with dashboards and visualizations includes one or more of the following tasks.
#### Select a visualization

+ To select a visualization to show specific data insights.
+ To find and compare visualization options.
#### Generate and configure visualizations

+ Write a search to generate a visualization. Make sure that the search returns results in the correct format for rendering the visualization.
+ Visualizations created in Classic Dashboards and visualizations can be created in Search & Reporting an added to a dashboard or report. Visualizations created using the Splunk Dashboard Studio can also be created in Search & Reporting and added to a pre-existing or new dashboard created in the Dashboard Studio, or can be created within the visual editor of the Dashboard Studio.
+ Configure or update visualization appearance and behavior. Change color modes, add captions, or adjust other visualization elements.
#### Build and edit dashboards

+ Add visualizations to new or existing dashboards in the classic Splunk dashboard framework or in Dashboard Studio.
+ Work with the editing user interface to adjust dashboard components.
+ Convert a dashboard to a form by adding user inputs.
#### Share and manage dashboards

+ Export dashboards for sharing.
+ Manage permissions for viewing and editing dashboards.
+ Clone a dashboard or display a dashboard on the app home page.
#### Edit Simple XML
